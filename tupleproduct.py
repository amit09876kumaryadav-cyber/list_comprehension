#write a program to calculate the product,multiplying all the numbers of the given tuple
#step 1: Define a tuple with numbers
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    #step 3: Use a loop to multiply numbers one by one
for num in numbers:
        product *= num
#step 4: Show the product
print("The product of numbers in the tuple is:", product)
